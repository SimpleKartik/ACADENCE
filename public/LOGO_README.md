# Logo Integration

The Acadence platform uses a transparent logo background on all pages.

## Logo File Location

Place your logo file at: `/public/logo.svg`

The logo will automatically appear as a low-opacity (5%) background on:
- Home page
- Role selection page
- All login pages
- All dashboard pages

## Logo Requirements

- Format: SVG (recommended) or PNG
- Name: `logo.svg` (or update CSS if using different format)
- The logo will be automatically scaled and centered
- Opacity is set to 5% to maintain readability

## Current Status

The logo background is configured but will be invisible until you add the logo file to `/public/logo.svg`.
